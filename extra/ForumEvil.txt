I'm just trying to understand why people do not like my content. I do not go out of my way to harass anyone just make friendly content I enjoy making such as wiring and killing bosses. So what If I'm good at PvP too. Just because I may or may not be better then someone at pvp does not mean you have to data-mine them and look/setup someone for "Cheating". Like who cares you lost more on, think they cheating? Block and move on.
